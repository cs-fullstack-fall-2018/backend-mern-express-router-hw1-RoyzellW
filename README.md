Watch this video and tell me about it below: https://youtu.be/26wm0IQsDCs.

the video explained that routes are basically middleware that allow you to modify or control over sub parts. 
it also talked about how to use app.use to pass any routes into specific methods like router.get 
that means if you used app.get on any spectic routes it would not work because app.use(('/api'), router) is referring to a router and not app.
